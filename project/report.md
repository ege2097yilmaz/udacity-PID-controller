This project implements a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller, which is widely used for real-time autonomous systems. Below is a detailed explanation of how PID works, its effects, tuning strategies, and possible improvements.

## PID Control Effects
The PID controller calculates the control command using three terms:
Note thet: Plots can be seen in plots directory.

*   Proportional (P):
    This term produces an output proportional to the current error. A higher proportional gain will result in a stronger, faster correction but can also cause overshooting if too aggressive.

*   Integral (I):
    The integral term accounts for past accumulated errors. It is particularly useful for eliminating steady-state errors but can cause overshoot if the gain is too high.

*   Derivative (D):
    This term predicts future errors by measuring the rate of change in the error. It helps to smooth out the system response and reduces overshooting and oscillations.

## Automatic PID Tuning
There are several methods to automatically tune the PID parameters. In this project, Ziegler Nichols method has been used to optimize Kp, Kd, Ki parameters.

The Zieglerâ€“Nichols method is a popular technique for tuning PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controllers. The goal is to set the controller gains to achieve a desired system response, often balancing between fast response and stabilit.

### Increase Proportional Gain (P)
* Start by setting the Integral (I) and Derivative (D) gains to zero.
* Gradually increase the Proportional (P) gain until the system begins to oscillate with a constant amplitude.
* This point where the system exhibits consistent oscillations is called the ultimate gain (Ku), and the time period of the oscillation is the ultimate period (Pu).

### Use Oscillation Data
Once determining the Ku and Pu we can run the Ziegler_optimizng.py script that reads throttle and steering errors and output Ki, Kd and Kp parameters.

### Fine-Tuning
After applying the calculated values, I made some changes to refine the system because I ve faced some problem with Kd parameter. The output of Ziegler method was 

``` Cpp
double steer_Kp = 0.82;  
double steer_Ki = 0.0007;
double steer_Kd = 1e-6; 

double throttle_Kp = 0.1; 
double throttle_Ki = 0.0009;
double throttle_Kd = 1e-6;
```

I found the optimal values are 
```Cpp
double steer_Kp = 0.78;  
double steer_Ki = 0.00087;
double steer_Kd = 0.0001;

double throttle_Kp = 0.125; 
double throttle_Ki = 0.0019;
double throttle_Kd = 0.00001;
```

## Pros of a Model-Free PID Controller
Simplicity and Ease of Implementation
* PID controllers are straightforward to design and implement. The tuning process typically involves adjusting three parameters

Versatility
* PID controllers can be applied to a wide variety of systems, making them a go-to solution in many engineering applications

No Need for a Detailed System Model
* Unlike model-based controllers (such as Model Predictive Control or LQR), PID controllers do not need an accurate model of the system being controlled

Low Computational Cost
* The computational requirements for a PID controller are minimal, making them suitable for real-time applications 

## Cons of a Model-Free PID Controller
Limited Performance in Complex Systems
* Since a PID controller does not rely on a model of the system, it may struggle to handle highly system dynamics.

Suboptimal Tuning
* Tuning a PID controller can be challenging in some systems, especially without a model to guide the process. SOmetimes PID should be tunned adaptively based on system state

No Predictive Capabilities
* Unlike model-based controllers, which can anticipate future states of the system, a PID controller reacts only to current and past errors

# Improvements
* Better refinement tecniques or parameters can be used to run PID controller
* Implement adaptive PID parameters that can adjust in real-time based on system state
* Add a feedforward control component to preemptively adjust the control signal based on known disturbances or inputs
